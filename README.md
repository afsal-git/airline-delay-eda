# Airline Delay Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Analyze airline arrival delays to identify key causes, frequency vs impact, and operational insights using Python.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Power BI

## Dataset
US airline arrival delay data (December 2020) containing flight counts and delay causes across airports and carriers.

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and missing value analysis
- Distribution analysis of arrival delays
- Delay cause analysis (carrier, weather, NAS, late aircraft, security)
- Frequency vs total delay impact comparison
- Normalized delay per flight analysis
- Carrier and airport-level delay comparison

## Key Insights
- Carrier-related delays contribute the highest total delay impact.
- Late aircraft delays are the second-largest contributor.
- Weather delays have lower overall impact compared to operational causes.
- Normalizing delay by flight count provides more meaningful insights.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
This project includes an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing airline arrival delays and their root causes.

### Dashboard Highlights
- Breakdown of total delay impact by cause
- Delay percentage contribution by category
- Top airports and carriers by delay minutes
- Key KPIs summarizing overall delay impact

## Limitations
- Dataset contains data for a single month (December 2020), limiting seasonal trend analysis.

## Conclusion
Improving aircraft turnaround efficiency and carrier operations could significantly reduce airline arrival delays.
